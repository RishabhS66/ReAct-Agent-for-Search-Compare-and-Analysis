        "# ReAct Agent with Multiple Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on the implementation of a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent inspired by the work of [Yao et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). The agent is designed to handle complex queries by effectively reasoning about which tool to use and when, leveraging a suite of three primary tools: search, compare, and analyze.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives:\n",
        "1. **Search Tool**: Integration of SerpAPI to perform web searches, with results formatted for efficient use by the ReAct agent.\n",
        "2. **Comparison Tool**: A custom tool enabling the agent to compare multiple items across specified categories.\n",
        "3. **Analysis Tool**: Utilization of Gemini v1.5 model (from Google Vertex AI) to summarize and extract key insights from search results and comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project bridges advanced reasoning techniques with practical applications, showcasing the potential of ReAct agents in solving real-world challenges."

            "The top 3 smartphones of 2023, according to various sources, are the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, Google Pixel 9 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max.  In terms of camera quality, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is expected to lead in megapixels and zoom, while the Google Pixel 9 Pro excels in computational photography for natural-looking images and AI features. The iPhone 16 Pro Max offers a balanced approach with strong performance and ease of use.  For battery life, all three offer excellent performance, with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max potentially lasting the longest, even under heavy use. The best choice depends on individual priorities: maximum detail and zoom (S24 Ultra), natural photos and AI (Pixel 9 Pro), or a balanced and user-friendly experience (iPhone 16 Pro Max).\n"
